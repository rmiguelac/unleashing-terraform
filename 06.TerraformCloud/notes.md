## Terraform Cloud

Has ```access control```, ```private registry``` for sharing modules, ```policy control```, ```cost estimation``` and more 

**QUESTION:** can terraform cloud integrate with slack/teams?
    * Yes, slack has its own integration method, but we can also use email or [webhooks](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/notifications.html)
